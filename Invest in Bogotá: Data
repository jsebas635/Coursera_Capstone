To solve this problem I will use information given by Foursquare relating with restaurants, car parking and bars. In each case I want
to use K-means to deal with density problems and to provide stakeholder the best region he can invest his money. For example
If you run an initial code of restaurants near to Corferias, you will see that most of this type of commerce is located at western
of the event center, so that I forecast that it would be better to setup a restaurant in other location. I will do that with three 
distinct types of commerce and will compare between these. 

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare 
location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare 
location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, 
even if it is only Foursquare location data.
