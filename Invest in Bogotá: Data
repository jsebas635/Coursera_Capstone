An open-source API, which is publicly available in GitHub, is used to retrieve longitude and latitude coordinates of the center of 
boroughs. The API includes coordinates of all cities and boroughs in Bogot√°. The information of Corferias is parsed through URL query.

To solve this problem I will use information given by Foursquare relating with restaurants, car parking and bars. In each case I want
to use K-means to deal with density problems and to provide stakeholder the best region he can invest his money. For example
If you run an initial code of restaurants near to Corferias, you will see that most of this type of commerce is located at western
of the event center, so that I forecast that it would be better to setup a restaurant in other location. I will do that with three 
distinct types of commerce and will compare between these.
